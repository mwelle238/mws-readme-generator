# MWs Readme Generator

## Description

I was motivated to build a readme generator by the need to have a quality readme with all of my projects.

I built this readme generator to help me create a quality readme from scratch.

This readme generator solves the problem of having to copy previous readmes and change them when the projects are not similar.

In creating this readme generator, I learned more of what a quality readme should contain.  I also learned how to use inquierer to prompt users for data and how to write that data to a file.
